  description: "Light Screen reduces damage from Special attacks by 50%, for 5 turns.
    Its effects apply to all Pok\xE9mon on the user's side of the field.\r\n\r\nIf
    the user is holding Light Clay when Light Screen is used, its effects last for
    8 turns.\r\n\r\nThe move Brick Break, when used against an Pok\xE9mon under Light
    Screen's effect, will remove the screen before dealing damage. The ability Infiltrator
    bypasses the effects of Light Screen.\r\n\r\nLight Screen is the Special counterpart
    to Reflect."
