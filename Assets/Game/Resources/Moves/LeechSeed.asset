  description: "Leech Seed plants a seed on the target that drains 1\u20448 of its
    maximum HP at the end of each turn and restores it to the user, or any Pok\xE9mon
    that takes its place. It does not work on Grass-type Pok\xE9mon; it does technically
    work against Pok\xE9mon with the Magic Guard ability, but no HP will be sapped.\r\n\r\nIf
    the user is holding a Big Root, the move still saps the same amount of HP but
    recovers 30% more than normal. For example, if a Pok\xE9mon has 320 HP, Leech
    Seed would cause them to lose 40 HP each turn but the seeder would recover 52
    HP.\r\n\r\nIf used on a Pok\xE9mon with the ability Liquid Ooze, the user instead
    loses the HP it would have otherwise gained. The seeded Pok\xE9mon can clear
    Leech Seed by switching out or using Rapid Spin."
